I am currently employed as a Tenure-Track Assistant Professor at Pen-Tune Sah instinite of Micro-Nano Science and Technology, Xiamen University.  My research focuses on brain-inspired vision and brain-inspired computing, with representative works including the Tianmouc chip and the [[TianmouCV](https://github.com/Tianmouc)] project. I welcome collaborations—please feel free to contact me.
